This is the original JsonifyCraft. **This version is retired and a replacement is being made.** Feel free to use this until the replacement catches up in features, but know that the grammar and functionality may very well change.

Here is a list of new versions for each of the Minecraft versions:

* [JsonifyCraft-1.12](https://github.com/tmetcalfe89/JsonifyCraft-1.12)
* [JsonifyCraft-1.14](https://github.com/tmetcalfe89/JsonifyCraft-1.14)
